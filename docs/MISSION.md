# ChiguyuSubs Mission

## Why This Exists

I want to watch more Japanese comedy (お笑い), and I want to share obscure content with other fans.

Current options:
- Wait for professional subs (rarely happens for obscure content)
- Use Whisper-only subs (rough quality, often criticized)
- Manually subtitle (extremely time-consuming)

This tool aims to produce better-than-Whisper subtitles by using multimodal AI that can see the video, not just hear it.

## What It Does

**Input:** Japanese comedy video
**Output:** Subtitle file

**How it's better than Whisper alone:**
- Sees on-screen text (name cards, captions)
- Includes visual context (reactions, scene changes)
- Can be prompted for comedy-specific awareness

**What you still need to do:**
- Review and edit the output
- Add cultural notes if sharing with community
- Fix any errors

## Target Quality

**Good enough to:**
- Watch and understand the content
- Share with community without apologies
- Serve as solid baseline for further editing

**Not aiming for:**
- Broadcast-quality perfection
- Professional-level cultural annotation
- Zero errors

## Scope

**In scope:**
- Japanese comedy (漫才, バラエティ, コント, 落語)
- Features that improve transcription/translation quality
- Comedy-aware processing

**Out of scope:**
- Other languages
- Non-comedy content
- Real-time streaming
- Backend services

## Why Comedy-Focused?

This is a hobby project maintained by one person. Focusing on one use case keeps it sustainable and makes the output quality better than a general-purpose tool.

If you want to use this for other content, you're welcome to fork it.
